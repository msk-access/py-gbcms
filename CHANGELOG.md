and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.8.0] - 2026-02-23

### ✨ Added
- **PairHMM alignment backend**: Alternative Phase 3 alignment via `--alignment-backend hmm` with probabilistic scoring using base quality probabilities. Configurable LLR threshold (default 2.3 ≈ ln(10)) and gap probabilities for repeat/non-repeat regions. 6 new CLI options. Exposed as first-class Nextflow params in `nextflow.config`
- **MNP min-BQ-across-block quality strategy**: MNP quality now assessed using min(BQ) across the entire block, matching C++ GBCMS `baseCountDNP`. Low-quality MNP reads now fall through to `check_complex` for masked comparison instead of being silently skipped
- **Per-phase ClassifyResult counters**: Diagnostic counters track how many reads are resolved in each classification phase (Phase 1/2/2.5/3)
- **`--trace` flag**: Two-tier Rust logging — `--verbose` for debug, `--trace` for per-read classification diagnostics via pyo3-log

### 🔧 Fixed
- **Phase 2/2.5 overcounting**: Complex variants with `REF >> ALT` now skip Phase 2 Case B and Phase 2.5 when `ref_len > 2 × alt_len` — short ALT trivially matches, edit distance is biased toward shorter allele
- **Phase 3 bypass for pure DEL/INS**: Removed `is_worth_realignment` prefilter — CIGAR structure is ground truth for pure deletions/insertions, prefilter was overcounting
- **DP anchor overlap**: Now uses single-position check (`read_start ≤ variant.pos`), matching Mutect2, VarDictJava, and samtools mpileup standard
- **MNP LowQuality routing**: LowQuality reads now fall through to `check_complex` for masked comparison instead of being skipped entirely
- **S3 underflow guard**: Guards against negative `ctx_offset` in deletion S3 validation

### 🏗️ Refactored
- **Rust module structure**: Split `counting.rs` (1904 LOC) and `normalize.rs` (1221 LOC) into idiomatic module directories: `counting/` (7 modules) and `normalize/` (7 modules)
- **AlignmentBackend threading**: `AlignmentBackend` enum threaded through all Phase 3 call sites

### 📚 Documentation
- **Comprehensive audit**: 28 fixes across 23 files — all GitBook URLs → MkDocs, version templating (X.Y.Z), undocumented CLI options, 5 mermaid diagrams updated for post-2.7.0 logic, architecture module tree refreshed, PairHMM documented end-to-end
- Deleted stale `nextflow/CHANGES.md`

### 🧹 Chores
- Fix all cargo clippy warnings
- Fix ruff lint issues, black formatting
- Update test expectations for new behavior
- CI: skip test workflow for docs-only changes

### 🧪 Tests
- 8 Python alignment backend integration tests
- 5 SW-vs-PairHMM concordance tests
- 10 MNP unit tests
- Multi-allelic isolation, DP/neither, fragment consensus, normalization tests

## [2.7.0] - 2026-02-19

### ✨ Added
- **Phase 2.5 edit distance fallback**: When read reconstruction length matches neither REF nor ALT (e.g., incomplete MAF definition), Levenshtein distance discriminates the closest allele with >1 edit margin safety guard
- **Phase 3 local SW fallback**: Complex variants where semiglobal alignment produces confident-but-wrong calls (e.g., EPHA7 `TCC→CT`) are now rescued via local Smith-Waterman that soft-clips mismatched flanks. Dual-trigger requires both score reversal and ≥2-point margin

### 🔧 Fixed
- **Allele-based dispatch** (`check_allele_with_qual`): Routes by `ref_len × alt_len` instead of unreliable `variant_type` string labels. SNP (1×1), insertion (1×N), deletion (N×1), MNP (N×N equal), complex (N×M unequal) — eliminates misrouting when callers emit inconsistent type annotations
- **SW semiglobal argument order**: Fixed `ref_hap`/`alt_hap` argument swap in semiglobal alignment that was scoring reads against the wrong haplotype
- **Haplotype trimming removed**: Eliminated shared symmetric trim that caused `slice index starts at 7 but ends at 6` panics on asymmetric indels; replaced with validated per-haplotype bounds
- **MNP fallback**: MNP reads now correctly fall through to SW alignment instead of silently returning "neither" on partial mismatches
- **Dual-count guard**: Prevents a single read from being counted as both REF and ALT when SW scores are exactly equal
- **Soft-clip restriction**: Soft-clipped bases no longer incorrectly contribute to variant region reconstruction
- **Strand bias orientation**: Strand bias (Fisher's exact) now couples to the winning allele, not the raw alignment orientation
- **Interior REF quality proxy**: Reads falling entirely within a large deletion (>50bp) now use median base quality instead of 0
- **Interior REF guard removed**: Eliminated the `has_large_cigar_del` guard that massively overcounted REF for large deletions by misclassifying ALT-supporting reads

### 🧹 Chores
- **Clippy**: Removed unused `has_large_cigar_del` variable
- **Tests**: Updated `test_fuzzy_complex::TestLengthMismatch` expectation to reflect Phase 3 local SW fallback behavior

## [2.6.1] - 2026-02-19

### 🔧 Fixed
- **Per-haplotype trimming**: Fixed `slice index starts at 7 but ends at 6` panic in `counting.rs` on asymmetric indels. Replaced shared symmetric trim with independent per-haplotype `trim_haplotype()` function that calculates bounds safely for each allele

### ✨ Added
- **Tolerant REF validation**: Variants with ≥90% REF match against the FASTA are now counted (status `PASS_WARN_REF_CORRECTED`) instead of being silently rejected. The FASTA REF is used for haplotype construction. Variants with <90% match are still rejected as `REF_MISMATCH`

### 📚 Documentation
- **Visual posters**: Added overview, normalization, and read-filter/counting-metrics posters (JPG) to reference documentation pages with lightbox support
- **Embedded PDFs**: Added inline PDF viewer for allele classification guide and detailed overview presentation via `mkdocs-pdf` plugin
- **Variant normalization**: Updated REF validation docs with 3-tier flowchart, `PASS_WARN_REF_CORRECTED` status, and EGFR exon 19 real-world example

### 🔧 CI
- **`deploy-docs.yml`**: Added `mkdocs-pdf` to docs CI pip install dependencies

## [2.6.0] - 2026-02-18

### ✨ Added
- **Adaptive context padding**: Dynamically increases `ref_context` flanking in tandem repeat regions (homopolymer through hexanucleotide). Formula: `max(default, repeat_span/2 + 3)`, capped at 50bp. Enabled by default (`--adaptive-context/--no-adaptive-context`)
- **`gbcms normalize` command**: Standalone variant normalization (left-align + REF validate) without counting, outputs TSV with original and normalized coordinates
- **Nextflow parameters**: `fragment_qual_threshold`, `context_padding`, `show_normalization`, `adaptive_context` now configurable in `nextflow.config`
- **Docs restructure**: Split monolithic `variant-counting.md` into 4 focused pages: Variant Normalization, Allele Classification, Counting Metrics, Read Filters
- **HPC install docs**: Micromamba-based source install with Python 3.13

### 🔧 Fixed
- **Interior REF guard** for large deletions (>50bp): Reads falling entirely within a deleted region are now correctly classified as REF instead of ALT by Smith-Waterman
- **Windowed reciprocal overlap**: Improved shifted indel detection using bidirectional overlap scoring
- **Complex variant counting** (EPHA7 `TCC→CT`): Fixed base quality extraction for all variant-type handlers (`check_insertion`, `check_deletion`, `check_mnp`, `check_complex`)
- **MAF VCF-style conversion**: Corrected complex variant handling in MAF→internal coordinate conversion
- **Lint**: Fixed ruff I001/E402/B905 and black formatting in `pipeline.py`

### 🔄 Changed
- **Dead code removed**: `GenomicInterval` class, `Variant.interval` property, `fragment_counting` config field
- **`fetch_single_base()` refactored**: Delegates to `fetch_region()`, removing 33 lines of duplicated chr-prefix retry logic
- **Release guide**: Updated version locations table with exact line numbers and verification command
- **Nextflow pipeline diagram** added to docs index

## [2.5.0] - 2026-02-12

### ✨ Added
- **`--preserve-barcode` flag**: Keeps original `Tumor_Sample_Barcode` from input MAF instead of overriding with BAM sample name (MAF→MAF workflows)
- **`--column-prefix` parameter**: Controls prefix for gbcms count columns in MAF output (default: none; use `--column-prefix t_` for legacy compatibility) ⚠️
- **`CoordinateKernel`**: Centralized MAF↔internal 0-based coordinate conversion with variant-type-aware logic for SNP, insertion, deletion, and complex variants
- **Nextflow `FILTER_MAF` module**: Per-sample MAF variant filtering by `Tumor_Sample_Barcode` supporting exact match, regex, and multi-select (comma-separated) modes
- **Nextflow `PIPELINE_SUMMARY` module**: Aggregated per-sample filtering statistics with formatted console output
- **Nextflow `--filter_by_sample` parameter** and samplesheet `tsb` column for multi-sample MAF workflows
- **Nextflow documentation**: Samplesheet `tsb` column guide, `--filter_by_sample` parameter reference, multi-sample MAF filtering examples

### 🔧 Fixed
- **Fragment quality extraction** (critical): All variant-type handlers (`check_insertion`, `check_deletion`, `check_mnp`, `check_complex`) now return actual `base_qual` from CIGAR walk instead of 0 — fixes systematic ALT undercount for indels in fragment-level consensus
- **FILTER_MAF heredoc conflict**: Restructured script from Python shebang to `python3 << 'PYEOF'` pattern, resolving `SyntaxError` from bash syntax in Python context
- **FILTER_MAF string quoting**: Changed to single-quoted Python strings for Nextflow variable interpolation to prevent CSV-parsed double-quote conflicts
- **`splitCsv` quote handling**: Added `quote:'"'` parameter for correct RFC 4180 parsing of comma-separated TSB values within quoted CSV fields
- **mypy `no-redef` error**: Removed redundant type annotation in `output.py` else branch

### 🔄 Changed
- **MAF output column prefix default**: Changed from `t_` to empty string (no prefix). Use `--column-prefix t_` for legacy `t_ref_count` / `t_alt_count` style columns ⚠️
- **`MafWriter` refactored**: MAF→MAF path preserves all original columns verbatim; VCF→MAF path builds row from GDC fieldnames with `CoordinateKernel` coordinate conversion
- **Nextflow `GBCMS_RUN` input**: Variants bundled into sample tuple `(meta, bam, bai, variants)` instead of separate channel
- **Nextflow `GBCMS` workflow**: Simplified to 2-channel interface (`ch_samples`, `ch_fasta`) from 3 channels
- **Nextflow config**: Added `column_prefix`, `preserve_barcode`, `filter_by_sample` parameters

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-10

### ✨ Added
- **Fragment Consensus Engine**: `FragmentEvidence` struct with u64 QNAME hashing and quality-weighted R1/R2 consensus; ambiguous fragments are discarded (not assigned to REF)
- **`--fragment-qual-threshold`**: New CLI option (default 10) controlling consensus quality difference for fragment conflict resolution
- **Windowed Indel Detection**: ±5bp positional scan with 3-layer safeguards (sequence identity, closest match, reference context validation)
- **Quality-Aware Complex Matching**: Masked comparison that ignores bases below `--min-baseq`; 3-case comparison (equal-length, ALT-only, REF-only) with ambiguity detection
- **Variant Counting Guide**: New `docs/reference/variant-counting.md` with algorithm diagrams for all variant types (~700 lines)
- **MAF Normalization Docs**: Added indel normalization and coordinate handling to `docs/reference/input-formats.md`
- **47 Tests**: Up from 16 — added `test_shifted_indels.py` (15), `test_fuzzy_complex.py` (14), `test_fragment_consensus.py` (4)

### 🔄 Changed
- **`--min-baseq` default**: `0` → `20` (Phred Q20) — activates quality masking by default for improved accuracy on low-coverage samples ⚠️
- **`--version` flag**: Added to CLI (`gbcms --version`)
- **Deploy-Docs Workflow**: Replaced `mkdocs gh-deploy` with `mike` for multi-version documentation; deploys `stable` (tagged version) from main and `dev` from develop branch; added `extra.version.provider: mike` to `mkdocs.yml` with version switcher widget

### 🔧 Fixed
- **Fragment double-counting bug**: R1+R2 pairs previously counted as two independent observations; now collapsed via quality-weighted consensus
- **MAF Input Hardening**: Graceful handling of missing/malformed fields with warnings instead of crashes
- **CI Release Pipeline**: Stabilized manylinux builds — migrated from manylinux_2_28 to manylinux_2_34, resolved OpenSSL/CURL vendor conflicts via `docker-options` pattern
- **Type stubs**: `_rs.pyi` and `gbcms_rs.pyi` synced with Rust bindings (added `ref_context`, `ref_context_start`, `fragment_qual_threshold`)
- **Linting**: All files pass black, ruff, and mypy

1. **CLI syntax**: Use `gbcms run` instead of `python -m gbcms.cli`
2. **Output format**: VCF/MAF column structures have changed
3. **Default behavior**: Only duplicate filtering enabled by default (was: all filters)
4. **Dependencies**: Requires Rust toolchain for installation from source
5. **Python version**: Minimum Python 3.10 (was: 3.8)

### 📦 Installation

```bash
# From PyPI (includes pre-built wheels)
pip install gbcms

# From source (requires Rust)
pip install git+https://github.com/msk-access/gbcms.git

# Docker
docker pull ghcr.io/msk-access/gbcms:2.0.0
```

### 🙏 Acknowledgments

This rewrite was designed and implemented with a focus on correctness, performance, and modern best practices in bioinformatics software development.
